# DBChatBot Project Overview

The **DBChatBot** project integrates several cutting-edge technologies to create a dynamic and interactive chatbot. Below is a detailed explanation of the key components:

## Components

### 1. LangGraph
LangGraph is a framework used for constructing and visualizing knowledge graphs. It helps the chatbot understand relationships between entities and generate more contextually aware responses.

### 2. Gemini LLM (Large Language Model)
Gemini is a powerful language model used to process and generate natural language responses. It interprets user queries and creates conversational, AI-generated paragraphs based on the data it retrieves.

### 3. Django REST API
Django is the backend framework that exposes RESTful APIs, allowing communication between the frontend and the database. These APIs manage requests such as querying data and generating responses based on user input.

### 4. React
React is used for building the frontend of the chatbot, providing a smooth and responsive user interface. It offers a component-based structure for managing dynamic data and real-time interactions.

### 5. Axioms
Axioms are foundational rules or principles that guide the chatbotâ€™s logic. They structure the conversational flow, ensuring the chatbot generates accurate queries and provides relevant responses.

## Project Summary

The **DBChatBot** project combines AI-driven language processing, modern web technologies, and robust backend integration to deliver an advanced chatbot experience. Users can interact with the chatbot in a natural way, retrieving data from a structured database through context-aware interactions.
